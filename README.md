### Guitar Pedal Schematics

Margaret is a filthy fuzz with unusual stuttering harmonic beating at certain frequencies. It sounds like it's destroying itself.

Dist is an asymetrical half hard, half not-so-hard clipping distortion somewhat based on my beloved crate gx15r overdrive. Can get very hard, but still maintains some clarity due to the asymetrical shape.

Both use the big muff style tone circuit
